# Ultra: Multi-Granularity Topological Fusion for Anatomically Consistent Vasculature Parsing

This work is currently under review. The model training and evaluation are conducted based on the [nnU-Net](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet) framework. At this stage, only the customized trainer is available in this repository. The network architecture and the implementation of the proposed Pixel-wise Local Connectivity (PLC) module are not yet released and will be made publicly available upon acceptance of the paper. Thank you for your interest and understanding.
